## About

This is a wiki containing various Hearts of Iron 2 facts.
The wiki was made based on the Hearts of Iron 2 base game.
Arsenal of Democracy and Darkest Hour would have some major differences as they came later.
As most players play either AOD or DH as they are the newer better games, we somehow one day need to add in the differences.
To do that we would need the help of volunteers. Please don't hesitate to reach out on contact@hoi2bunker.com or using the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RbBuPtVM)
