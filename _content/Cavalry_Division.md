title: Cavalry_Division
---
 Cavalry Divisions (Cav) are able to move fairly rapidly over most types of terrain and do not require a supply of fuel to operate, but they are lightly armed when compared with Armoured units, and the automatic weapons of the time can inflict devastating casualties to both men and horses. That is not to say that Cavalry can't prove useful in some instances as a mobile reserve.

Notes
-----

*   Cavalry divisions are considered a soft unit.
*   It is often considered that _Basic Cavalry_ are a good place to stop for upgrading of units. Reasons include, cost effectiveness, Lack of Oil Consumption and the combat differences between _Basic Cavalry_ and _Semi-Motorised Cavalry_ being quite small.
*   Cavalry are often useful as disposable _raiders_ . When an enemy front has been _holed_ the Cav race through to attempt to either encircle the enemy troops or race to capture/deny resources, IC or Victory Points
*   Cavalry are classified in the category of [TECH\_CAT\_CAVALRY](/wiki/index.php?title=TECH_CAT_CAVALRY&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECH CAT CAVALRY (page does not exist)") and thus are affected by [Terrain](/wiki/index.php?title=Terrain&action=edit&redlink=1 "Terrain (page does not exist)") and [Weather](/wiki/Weather "Weather") differently to other land types
