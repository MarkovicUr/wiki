Infantry in such an environment.

## [ Notes ]{#Notes .mw-headline}

-   Mountain divisions are considered soft units
-   Mountaineers have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard
    attack values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a
    normal infantry of the same year.
-   They get far less combat penalties when fighting in winter, frozen,
    snow or even blizzard conditions.
-   They get attack and defence bonuses in mountains and hills, which
    increase further along the tech tree.
-   In fact, the defence bonuses can get so staggeringly high that it
    becomes impossible to get a few mountaineer divisions out of a
    mountainous province during winter using conventional warfare.
