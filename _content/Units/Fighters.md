Fighters are the backbone of any air force. They are used to achieve air
superiority against enemy bombers and fighters They are all-rounders,
being able to fulfill any mission given to them, but excelling at none
in particular.

-   They have moderate range, have the best air attack capability
    (without bonuses), and can be effective against ground targets.
    Their primary role is achieving air superiority: destroying enemy
    fighters and denying airspace to enemy bombers.

-   While a specialized air force is ideal, these craft are
    all-rounders. [Interceptors](/wiki/Interceptors "Interceptors") are
    superior at bomber interception (due to a bonus). If research or
    production choices are tight, develop the fighter first, as
    Interceptors need two additional techs before they can be upgraded
    to the turbojet version.

```{=html}

-   In a ground attack role, note that the hard attack capability of
    fighters is particularly high, comparable to that of
    [CAS](/wiki/CAS "CAS"){.mw-redirect} and
    [TAC](/wiki/index.php?title=TAC&action=edit&redlink=1 "TAC (page does not exist)"){.new}
    bombers. After air superiority has been achieved, fighters are ideal
    for giving bombing runs an extra punch against armoured targets.
    These units can also be effective against soft targets, but to a
    lesser extent.
