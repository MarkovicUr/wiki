::: mw-parser-output
Close Air Support (CAS) is the key to the blitzkrieg tactic. These
planes have the ability to strike precisely at enemy units, enabling
your ground forces to achieve a rapid breakthrough. They are slow,
sturdy planes and this makes them an easy target for enemy fighters.

- None

## [ Notes ]{#Notes .mw-headline}

- CAS are very vulnerable to an air attack. However, putting a
  [fighter](/wiki/Fighter "Fighter"){.mw-redirect} or
  [interceptor](/wiki/Interceptor "Interceptor"){.mw-redirect}
  division in your CAS stack will not help. In this case, the fighter
  will only prolong the air fight, resulting in higher losses than a
  pure CAS stack would suffer.
