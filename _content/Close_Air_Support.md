 Close Air Support (CAS) is the key to the blitzkrieg tactic. These planes have the ability to strike precisely at enemy units, enabling your ground forces to achieve a rapid breakthrough. They are slow, sturdy planes and this makes them an easy target for enemy fighters.

Brigades Allowed
----------------

*   None

Notes
-----

*   CAS are very vulnerable to an air attack. However, putting a [fighter](/wiki/Fighter "Fighter") or [interceptor](/wiki/Interceptor "Interceptor") division in your CAS stack will not help. In this case, the fighter will only prolong the air fight, resulting in higher losses than a pure CAS stack would suffer.
