 The Rocket or Ballistic Missile (e.g. the German V2) is designed to deliver a payload of explosives to a distant target. Its high speed makes it almost impossible to intercept but it is an expensive way of destroying the enemy with conventional explosives. Nuclear weapons are needed to give it more than psychological effect.
