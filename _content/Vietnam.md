 Vietnam War Version 4.0 by FRVP

Fantastic historical scenario 1963 - 1975. Although you play longer if you wish.

Playable countries: North and South Vietnam, Viet Cong, USA, USSR, Thailand, China, North and South Korea. Also included are Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Phillipines and Taiwan. Best played with agressive AI and hard difficulty settings.

Made for Armageddon v1.1 but should work for all with the patches. Unzip to Armaggedon, Doomsday or Ho2 directory.

Major change to map files, 25 textured territories added. Backup your originals! (see below) There are some minor changes and additions to some config, db, minister, leader and tech files. New graphics were added for a few new units, ministers, leaders and events. A few counters, flags and shields were modified. New AI files for countries involved were added.

New units: Nuclear Sub, M41 Light-Tank, Titan ICBM, Special Forces Green Beret. New technology: Jungle Warfare. New music: optional awesome sound track for the era in two zips: pre 68 and post 67, use one or both.
