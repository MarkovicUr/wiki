 Motorized Infantry make use of wheeled vehicles, such as trucks, to manoeuvre more rapidly than basic Infantry. But they are limited to roads and so their performance may suffer in provinces with low infrastructure levels.

Notes
-----

*   Motorized divisions are considered soft units
*   Because of their high speed, they are the prime targets for adding to [Mechanized Divisions](/wiki/Mechanized_Division "Mechanized Division") or [Armored Divisions](/wiki/Armored_Division "Armored Division") in a 1:2 ratio, to get the combined arms bonus.
