An **Anti-Submarine Warfare Group** is a group of ships whose role is to
hunt and sink enemy [subs](/wiki/Submarine "Submarine") . Since the
primary anti-sub vessel is the DD, this is the core of any ASW group. An
escort carrier is also very deadly for subs. In HoI2 and ARMA, ASW
fleets are quite useful, while in Doomsday, the ASW fleet was largely
ineffective. The Armageddon 1.3beta patch has solved all remaining bugs
with the ASW mission order, and it will now work as intended. Especially
late-game, it is very deadly.

#### [ ASW Fleet Composition ]{#ASW_Fleet_Composition .mw-headline}
