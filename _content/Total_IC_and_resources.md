title: Total_IC_and_resources
---
 Because the strategic aim of warfare in Hoi2 is to secure your own country's place in the world by conquering provinces with high IC and resources, it might be interesting to know how many of them are out there to claim. The following data is collected from the db/province.csv file and shows the raw numbers on the 1936 campaign start. Note that you will not gain the full value if the respective province is not a core of your country and also note that the raw values can be modified by a variety of factors ranging from research to events.

Thanks to the Paradox forum user BritishImperial, for it was his question which initiated this endeavour!

MOD: World in Flames Platinum (HoI2 DD Arma)
--------------------------------------------

Note that manpower is computed differently in this mod, so while the raw values are much higher than in the standard game, the effective values are quite similar (even somewhat lower).
