 ### [Escort Fighters](/wiki/Escort_Fighters "Escort Fighters")

Escort Fighters are long-range fighters, designed to escort bombers and keep enemy interceptors from the bombers. They are drilled in tactics to achieve this mission and receive a bonus when escorting bombers. In Air Superiority missions, they are less effective.

Hearts of Iron 2: Doomsday A major change in HOI2:DD is that \[\[Escort fighters\]\] are brigade type units attached to bombers. This results in better values for the bomber when intercepted by enemy planes, but also a lower range.
