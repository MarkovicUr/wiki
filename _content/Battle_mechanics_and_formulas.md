## [ Evaluation of battle ]{#Evaluation_of_battle .mw-headline}

The description how battle is evaluated step by step *(NOTE: not
finished)*

-   Army A (composed of units A1,A2\...) attacks army D (of D1, D2..)
-   all modifiers (ground, weather, river crossing, encirclement, ESE,
    command ..) are evaluated
-   combat events such as Surprise and Breakthrough are evaluated where
    applicable
-   Every unit of army A randomly chooses a unit to target from B and
    *vice versa*
-   All units targeting unit D1 sum their attack values (see softness)

if the attack_sum = Attack_1+Attack_2\... \> Defence_1 than D1 gets
2\*attack_sum - defence_1 hits else (i.e attack_sum \< Defence_1 ) D1
gets just attack_sum of hits

-   In each round of the battle the organisation of the unit is
    decreased by the number of hits it takes
-   If organisation of a unit reaches zero ( 0 ), the unit stops
    attacking
-   The army loses the battle as soon as no units can fight *(? - or
    below 5 org maybe)*

-   Breakthrough
-   Surprise

![{\\displaystyle {\\text{attack}}={\\text{hardattack}}\\cdot
(1-{\\text{softness}})+{\\text{softattack}}\\cdot
{\\text{softness}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/d7d78f5fefccb8311b85d8f5566f78b8356dbfa4){.mwe-math-fallback-image-inline

## [ Battle winning ability ]{#Battle_winning_ability .mw-headline}

In the approximation that attack affect just morale, the battle value of
soldiers could be evaluated as:

![{\\displaystyle {\\text{BWA}}={\\text{attack}}\\cdot
{\\text{organisation}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/c5eafe106944d5bec620ff024ece6c3d6435fafd){.mwe-math-fallback-image-inline
aria-hidden="true"
style="vertical-align: -0.671ex; width:29.373ex; height:2.509ex;"}

attack affects the rate in which unit will lower the organisation of
enemy organisation determines the time the unit can withstand a given
attack (time under constant attack deceasing its ORG)
