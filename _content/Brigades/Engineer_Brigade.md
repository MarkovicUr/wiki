## [ Effects ]{#Effects .mw-headline}

-   Engineer Brigades add +20 to [River
    Crossing](/wiki/index.php?title=River_Crossing&action=edit&redlink=1 "River Crossing (page does not exist)"){.new}
    , thus reducing the combat penalty for attacking across a river by
    20 (eg
    [INF](/wiki/index.php?title=INF&action=edit&redlink=1 "INF (page does not exist)"){.new}
    goes from -50 to -30)
-   When an Engineer Brigade is included in combat (i.e. Attacking)
    against an enemy province the damage to
    [Infrastructure](/wiki/index.php?title=Infrastructure&action=edit&redlink=1 "Infrastructure (page does not exist)"){.new}
    is increased.
-   Engineer Brigades are the only Brigade that provides a speed
    increase.

## [ Division ]{#Division .mw-headline}

The following are the list of Divisions that can have Engineer Brigades
attached, and some notes on thier effects.

-   [Armoured
    Division](/wiki/index.php?title=Armoured_Division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Armoured Division (page does not exist)"){.new}
    , Engineers are usually seen as only useful to Type I. as a speed
    increase.
-   [Light Armoured
    Division](/wiki/index.php?title=Light_Armoured_Division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Light Armoured Division (page does not exist)"){.new}
    , Engineers are rarely attached
-   [Cavalry Division](/wiki/Cavalry_Division "Cavalry Division") ,
    Engineers are never attached. They never increase the speed CAV
    types and the other advantages are negligable or useless.
-   [HQ Division](/wiki/HQ_Division "HQ Division") , Engineers are never
    attached. They never increase the speed and the other advantages are
    negligable or useless.
-   [Infantry Division](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") ,
    Engineers are most useful to Type I. to III. They remain slightly
    useful to all INF Types
-   [Motorized Division](/wiki/Motorized_Division "Motorized Division")
    , Engineers are rarely attached, the speed increase is negligable.
-   [Mechanized
    Division](/wiki/Mechanized_Division "Mechanized Division") ,
    Engineers are rarely attached, the speed increase is negligable.
-   [Garrison Division](/wiki/Garrison_Division "Garrison Division") ,
    UNKNOWN what effect.
-   [Mountain Division](/wiki/Mountain_Division "Mountain Division") ,
    Engineers are useful for Type I. Mountain Divisions, as they
    increase their speed. They do not increase the speed for any other
    Mountain Division.
-   [Marine Division](/wiki/Marine_Division "Marine Division") ,
    Engineers are rarely attached, there are usually better Brigades to
    attach. Speed being the not greatly useful to Marines

## [ Notes ]{#Notes .mw-headline}

The [Brigade Strategy
Guide](/wiki/Brigade_Strategy_Guide "Brigade Strategy Guide") lists
Engineer Brigades as useless. This guide is ment to be a little more
expansive.

-   **Engineers** are percieved poorly, mainly due to thier high
    manpower cost (2.5), also
    [Toughness](/wiki/index.php?title=Toughness&action=edit&redlink=1 "Toughness (page does not exist)"){.new}
    and
    [Defensiveness](/wiki/index.php?title=Defensiveness&action=edit&redlink=1 "Defensiveness (page does not exist)"){.new}
    do little in combat.

An example being that four [Infantry
Divisions](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") with Engineers
cost the same in manpower as five [Infantry
Divisions](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") . Five [Infantry
Divisions](/wiki/Infantry_Division "Infantry Division") are generally
seen as much more useful.
