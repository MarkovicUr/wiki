 [Template:ARMA v1.2](/wiki/index.php?title=Template:ARMA_v1.2&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:ARMA v1.2 (page does not exist)") The Destroyer is the smallest and the fastest of the surface ships. It is lightly armed in comparison with the battleship, but its speed and maneuvrability allow it to provide a good first line of defence away from the main capital ships of a fleet, and its light guns are useful for engaging aircraft. Destroyers are usually combined in groups and used for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.
