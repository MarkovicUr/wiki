Studio) as well as other developers\' through traditional retail
channels as well as digital distribution services, such as Steam or

## [ Game characteristics ]{#Game_characteristics .mw-headline}

The studio produces what it terms \"Grand Strategy games\", meaning ones
played on a real-world map, marked by the use of standard real-time
elements but with an ability to make any and all changes while paused
(and while unpaused). Almost all Paradox games have historical settings
and demonstrate a reasonable commitment to historical accuracy. The
focus of each game is different, but generally a player must manage the
economy, commerce, internal politics, diplomacy, technological
development, and military forces of a nation. Paradox Interactive games
are also characteristically complex, with highly detailed gameplay
models and consequently steep learning curves.

Paradox regularly releases patches to their games long after a game\'s
initial release. Some games have required patches shortly after release
to make them playable. Later patches may contain large changes to the
game and the way the game is played, in response to the demands and
requests of fans.

The games are mostly based on an open game engine sandbox-style game
with no set \"victory\" condition. Paradox tries to make games that are
open and easy to edit (moddable), from tweaking a saved game to creating
an entirely new scenario. Modding can be accomplished with simple tools
and basic knowledge of scripting. To assist modders to figure out how to
edit the game on their own, the Paradox forums provide fan-compiled
libraries of \"how to\" advice. Due to this, each game has a very large
number of mods, ranging from minor additions to complete system
overhauls.

## [ Forums ]{#Forums .mw-headline}

The complexity of the games often warrants player collaboration over the
forums. Often, players will assist other players with the games, post
modifications, and write \"after action reports\". Due to much of the
game content being in plain text and image files, the modification of
the games has become very popular. Much of the gameplay information used
by the engine is contained in uncompressed text and bitmap graphic
files. The ability to freely edit these files has allowed an active
modding community to develop.

After action reports, usually abbreviated as AARs on the forums, provide
a way for players to discuss their own gameplay in unique ways with
other players. AARs are reports written by players about their
experiences with a game, ranging in style from simple presentations of
the development of the game with screenshots to highly embellished
character-driven stories only loosely based on the events in the game.
They are generally serialized in a forum topic, with every update post
corresponding to a period of gameplay, and with comments and suggestions
made by readers between updates.
