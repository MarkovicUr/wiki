 From my look at the models.csv file, it gives the country-specific model names- such as ship classes. Unfortunately, many countries don't have all the names. Each line starts out with code: for example MODEL\_GER\_12\_1. GER is the country code. 12 gives the unit- in this case it's a fighter. 1 is the model- here it's model 1, Early Fighter. Afterwards come the names in different languages. The unit codes are as follows:

*   0= Infantry
*   1= Cavalry
*   2= Mot. Infantry
*   3= Mec. Infantry
*   4= L Arm
*   5= Arm
*   6= Airborne
*   7= Marines
*   8= Mountain
*   9= Garrison
*   10= HQ
*   11= Militia
*   12 = Int F
*   13 = Ftr
*   14 = Strat
*   15 = Tac
*   16 = Nav
*   17 = CAS
*   18 = Air Transport
*   19 = Flying Bomb
*   20 = Rocket
*   21 = BB
*   22 = CL
*   23 = CA
*   24 = BC
*   25 = DD
*   26 = CV
*   27 = CVL
*   28 = SS
*   29 = SSN
*   30 = TP

Note: Rocket model\_0 is flying rocket, model\_1 is ballistic missile and model\_2 is ICBM

Brigades also have unit codes like this: BRIG\_MODEL\_X\_Y Unit codes (X) are:

*   1= Art
*   2 = SP-ART
*   3 = Rocket Art
*   4 = SP Rocket
*   5 = AT
*   6 = Tank Destroyer
*   7 = Light Tank
*   8 = Heavy Tank
*   9 = Super-heavy Tank
*   10 = Armoured Car
*   11 = AA
*   12 = Police
*   13 = Engineer
*   14 = CAG
*   15 = Escort Fighter
*   16 = naval\_asw
*   17 = naval\_anti\_air\_s
*   18 = naval\_radar\_s
*   19 = naval\_fire\_controll\_s
*   20 = naval\_improved\_hull\_s
*   21 = naval\_torpedoes\_s
*   22 = naval\_anti\_air\_l
*   23 = naval\_radar\_l
*   24 = naval\_fire\_controll\_l
*   25 = naval\_improved\_hull\_l
*   26 = naval\_torpedoes\_l
