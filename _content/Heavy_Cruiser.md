 [Template:ARMA v1.2](/wiki/index.php?title=Template:ARMA_v1.2&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:ARMA v1.2 (page does not exist)") Heavy Cruisers are larger and more heavily armored than their lighter counterparts. They have larger main guns, giving them the ability to bombard enemy units on land. They are effective against enemy surface ships, especially destroyers and light cruisers, but are susceptible to air and submarine attacks.
