In Doomsday, Persia can have a militarist or democratic coup is dissent
is between 4 and 8. It occurs automatically if dissent hits 8.

In Doomsday, when the Soviet Union isn\'t at war with major powers, may
secede six provinces to Persia.

Persia also has an impact on other events:

- By having an alliance with United Kingdom, prevents the Iraqui coup
  and intervention in Syria/Lebanon (event 100003)
