title: Paratroop_Division
---
 Paratroopers are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained to either parachute to the ground or be ferried to a battle in gliders. Their rapid deployment capability makes them ideal for use as a mobile reserve or for use in capturing a strategic asset behind enemy lines. However, they are handicapped by a lack of heavy equipment due to their mode of travel, and when they are in action it is advisable to move other units to their support.

Notes
-----

*   Paratroop divisions are considered a soft unit.
*   Paratroopers have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard attack values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a normal infantry of the same year.

Paratroopers are much maligned by veteran players for several reasons:

*   They require players to pursue two research trees (paratroopers and transport planes)
*   Transport planes are extremely expensive in [IC days](/wiki/IC_days "IC days")
*   Transport planes have very limited range
*   Paratroopers are average at combat

| Unit | Soft Attack | Defensiveness | Manpower | Cost | BuildTime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Airborne 1939 | 8 | 11 | 15 | 12 | 210 |
| Infantry 1939 | 12 | 18 | 10 | 7 | 95 |

This means that the Airborne unit requires 2,520 IC days versus 665 IC days for Infantry, in exchange for considerably lower combat ability. A player could build _four Infantry divisions_ (2,660 IC days) for a roughly equivalent cost.

Paratroopers do have some positives:

*   Fun to use
*   Provide an extra envelopment angle if dropped into a battle. The bonus is then added to all your divisions engaged in the battle.
*   Paratroopers can be dropped into an empty province behind the enemy to close encirclements.
*   Paratroopers dropped on unprotected airfields will destroy all planes based there.
*   After an enemy loses a battle and is retreating into an adjacent province, if that province is empty, paratroopers can "overrun" the retreating enemy to destroy them. This can also be used defensively.
*   In critical battles, paratroopers can swing the outcome, specifically during amphibious assaults when only a relatively small number of marines can be used. Dropping paratroopers onto the beach province dramatically increases the chance of victory.
*   Paratroopers can be used to instantly cover ground that would otherwise take weeks for ground forces, such as the huge, low infrastructure provinces in C. Asia, Africa and S. America.
