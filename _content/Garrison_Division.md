Garrison Divisions (Gar) are second line troops used to safeguard
valuable objectives far from the front lines. They lack heavy equipment
and transportation, making them immobile except for strategic
redeployment. They have limited fighting capability but can be used to
free more capable troops for frontline use.

## [ Notes ]{#Notes .mw-headline}

-   Garrison divisions are considered soft units.
-   Garrison\'s have one job: Partisan Suppression.
-   Using Garrison\'s for anything else is usually either a desperate
    act or a misuse of troops. Garrison\'s should be measured on one
    thing, their *Suppresion* ability. Garrison \'39 are the most cost
    effective at doing this. Unless you know that you are going to need
    Partisan Suppression, you don\'t need Garrison Divisions.
