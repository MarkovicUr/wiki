 [Template:ARMA v1.2](/wiki/index.php?title=Template:ARMA_v1.2&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:ARMA v1.2 (page does not exist)") The Aircraft Carrier is rapidly becoming the most important naval vessel. Its ability to project power through the aircraft it carries makes it dangerous to other capital ships and land forces. However, the ship itself is only lightly armed and must rely on other naval units, as well as its own aircraft, to afford it protection.

*   [Carrier Air Group](/wiki/Carrier_Air_Group "Carrier Air Group")

Notes
-----

*   A carrier is considered a capital ship.
*   The base org and morale is 20 for Great War and Early carriers, 25 for Basic carriers and 30 for all others.
*   A carrier without a carrier air group is just a giant, expensive floating piece of metal.
