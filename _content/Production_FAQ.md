Any modifier that affects build time and IC cost, such as a minister
change, an assembly-line tech, or event, has no effect on what is
already in the build queue. New production orders created after the
change will take into account any sort of time/cost modifiers. As of the
1.2 patch in the HoI2:Doomsday expansion, build times and costs do
change.
