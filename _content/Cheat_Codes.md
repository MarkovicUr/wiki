 The following is an _incomplete_ listing of the cheat codes available within the game.

To use a cheat code, press the F12 key and a console window will be brought up. Enter a code from the following lists and press enter. If the code was entered correctly, you will see a confirmation message in the console. The cheats are not case-sensitive. To get out of the console mode, hold ctrl and hit F12 (or press F12 and move the mouse). Several cheats like showid, acceptall, freedom and others can be toggled on and off, i.e. they stay active until they are disabled or you exit the game. To disable these cheats enter the console (via F12) and type the same command again.
