Introduction
------------

The subject of this analysis is to recommend what type of division should make up the bulk of your Ground Self-Defense forces. For this, different types of infantry were selected for analysis. However, since motorized and mechanized infantry divisions are not available until around 1940, the earlier forms of Infantry divisions were dropped from the analysis. The later division types, mid-1940's, have also been dropped since they make a rather late appearance.

From the table above, one can note no significant difference in organization, morale, AA, AD, SA, HA and Manpower requirement. However, slight differences can be noted in Toughness and Defensiveness in favor of Infantry. However, the other division types are to a different extent hard targets as well, and will thus require enemy units to use HA in order to inflict damage. In regards to speed, Mechanized Infantry is superior. Mechanized Infantry does however consume roughly 28 % more fuel than Motorized Infantry, whilst Infantry is far more economic in both supply and has no fuel consumption. In regards to equipment, Infantry is yet again the most economic choice, costing only half that of the other two, when taking into account the extra month to field a Mechanized Infantry division it becomes even more costly.

Geography and weather
---------------------

Moving on to suitability in different terrain types, Infantry shows great versatility both when advancing and holding ground, and does not suffer as much as the Motorized and Mechanized Infantry divisions do in adverse terrain and weather conditions (although more specialized divisions are a superior choice if available).

My conclusion is that although mechanized infantry should be strongly favored when this type of division becomes available, there is no reason not to field a large amount of ordinary infantry divisions since these can also be used for counterinsurgency missions when mechanized infantry shoulders more of the responsibility in offense that in the early era ('36-'40) is given to ordinary infantry divisions. Later in the game mechanized infantry can be fielded in large quantities. However, due to the flexible nature of footborne divisions, they should still be able to remain the backbone of any army with the aid of panzer units, as well as CAS and tactical airwings after air superiority has been established.
