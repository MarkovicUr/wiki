title: Submarine

 [Template:ARMA v1.2](/wiki/index.php?title=Template:ARMA_v1.2&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:ARMA v1.2 (page does not exist)") The Submarine is designed to travel underwater allowing it to operate clandestinely against other naval units. Its main armament consists of torpedoes which are deadly against all other types of vessel, be they Carrier, Battleship, Naval Transport or another Submarine. However, the Submarine can be handicapped by a short range and new technologies to improve them can be expensive.

Notes
-----

*   Submarines cannot shore bombard. Instead, they have a higher convoy attack value (other ships use their sea attack).
