option in the diplomacy menu. You now have to go to \"Sue for Peace\",
then \"Insist on Demands\", and puppeting is available as a checkbox
option.

You may only trade blueprints with allied nations, your puppets or your
puppet master (as the case may be) that have not researched the
technology yet.

Paris to encourage Italy joining Axis.

As Germany the nations you can get alliances with via events areÂ :
Croatia, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Slovakia, USSR.

- Following the annexation of Yugoslavia an event will fire giving you
  the option to free Croatia in return for some free infantry
  divisions and they will join your alliance.

- The Austrian anschluss event allows you to ally with Austria rather
  than annexing them, if you so desire.

```

- The Molotov Ribbentrop pact event gives the USSR an opportunity to
  offer Germany an alliance. (The \"Unholy Alliance\") This is very
  rare to happen though and the AI tends to perform poorly under this
  arrangement.

```

- Slovakia and Czechoslovakia can both be brought to the axis also
  through different paths in the End of Czechoslovakia event chain.
- Hungary can be got through the Czechoslovakian event chain, if the
  Czechs decide to fight against Germany then Hungary will side with
  Germany.
