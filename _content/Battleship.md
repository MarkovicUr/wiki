 [Template:ARMA v1.2](/wiki/index.php?title=Template:ARMA_v1.2&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:ARMA v1.2 (page does not exist)") The Battleship is the Queen of the Sea. It is a massive floating gun platform, designed primarily to engage enemy capital ships at long range and send them to the bottom of the ocean. However, they are now vulnerable to air or submarine torpedo attacks, and the advent of the Aircraft Carrier has started to number their days.
