Playing as Sweden is actually rather easy, all you have to is play out
the major powers against each other.

## [ Peacetime ]{#Peacetime .mw-headline}

First order of business is to get another research team, so build 6 IC
each in 3 provinces (it doesn\'t matter which provinces you build them
in since you won\'t be fighting in Sweden. Move the slider to more free
market to get better build bonuses. You could also move the sliders
towards Authoritarian if you want to invade Norway later. Just keep
building IC and researching industry, infantry & upgrade your troops in
peacetime but then again, it doesn\'t matter much since you won\'t be
using Swedish forces to win the war. Kill time by improving relations
with Germany.

## [ Wartime ]{#Wartime .mw-headline}

Join the first winter war to get more interventionism and if possible
try to take control over the Finnish forces. Don\'t bother actually
trying to win the war by sending your troops into Finland. The SU is
just too powerful and you won\'t gain anything by invading SU from
Finland. Instead just let the war drag on and make sure that FIN is weak
but not weak enough to be annexed (yet). When the peace-events comes,
accept them. By now, FIN is rather weak and should probably have lost a
lot of divisions. And now you are back to peace.

## [ The Waiting Game ]{#The_Waiting_Game .mw-headline}

Germany will probably run over SU at first so you can just relax for a
while and also all of your factories should be done about this time so
start producing some Marines and Mountaineers. After a couple of months
you should be ready to join the Axis so take military control over
Germany and Finland. Move Guderians 9 Panzer to Luleå and at the same
time make sure that Finland is annex by SU. At the same time make sure
that you kill as many Russian divisions as possible with German forces,
since it\'s not your troops or your land you can have fun with all kinds
of strategies. When the SU have annexed Finland and most Russian forces
are dead, withdraw all German forces from SU and put them on hold in
Poland. Now is the time to strike out from Sweden with German panzer. In
a matter of months you should have control over all the Baltic\'s. From
there you just have to push forward and annex SU from Swedish territory.

And voilà, a new Swedish empire. From there you can pretty much do
whatever you want. Maybe strike into china? Maybe take Norway? Maybe
attack Turkey and push forward into Africa?

This was tested in 1.02

## [ Neutrality ]{#Neutrality .mw-headline}

Sweden has during her lifetime avoided war and the Swedish people are
rather avoiding to interfere in any hostile actions. Why not try this
strategy in HOI2?

Before I can give you any hints you should notice that this strategy is
different and dove compared to conventional gameplay of Hearts of Iron
2.

Sweden begins with only a few units on land and a practically
non-existent airforce wich in case of war would not make significant
damage. However her navy is somewhat powerfull and should be used as a
first front line to repell aggression from Germany or the Soviet Union.
All the neighbours of Sweden will be at war, sooner or later, which will
hamper the trade of this country. Be sure to get enough resources to
your pool before the war begins, you should be able to survive without
any bigger trade deals during the war.

Concentrating a big portion of Industrial Capacity for producing
Consumer Goods might sometimes give an additional factory and increase
your capacity.

War is not your biggest strength, with underpowered forces and a too big
country to defend it is not wise to engage in war, well, at least not in
the beginning.

Norwegian and Finnish support is recommended. Try to send forces and
supplies to both countries to help them prevent getting occupied by
either Germany or the Soviet Union but do not engage in combat yet.

When Germany is at the brink of an utterly defeat, then you can engage
in combat by helping the Allies liberate Norway and Denmark. Joining
their alliance for a short time is recommended since you will not only
get an economic support by also blueprints for future development.

Good luck and try to avoid a bloodshed!

## [ Use WWII to your advantage ]{#Use_WWII_to_your_advantage .mw-headline}

Sweden starts with rather small army and almost non existing air force
but they start with good naval armies. This strategy enables you Sweden
to become a Major power and also, It\'s quite fun to play. Remember to
enable the option so that democracies can declare War. Also Full IC Take
over is recommended You have to Annex Norway, Denmark, Latvia, Estonia
and Lithuania before the German or Soviet Union.

The first you shall do is to trade you metal for a huge amount of energy
from Germany, German Energy is quite and you don\'t have to worry about
your metal stockpile. Then Trade supply and metal for money from either
Soviet Union or another country nearby (I used to make this deal with
USSR and The Republic of Spain). If you want, you can also change your
ministers.Before you attack Norway, Be sure to produce some infantries
(and IC)

Then Move you troops to the Norwegian border and Cancel the
non-aggression pact and Declare war. Attack Oslo from the south but
don\'t battle the divsion in Narvik. Wait until it occupies one Swedish
province and then march in to Narvik. Once Narvik is yours, Annex
Norway. Ususaly the allied don\'t attack you if you do this quick and
early.

After Norway, Wait until Germany annexes Austria and the Declare war on
Denmark. Until now, your Infanteries shall be finished. Ferry some
divisions to odense and make more troops to attack and occupie
Copenhagen and then take Århus before Denmarks last Divison move there.

By now you shall have around 40 IC and a third Techslot (Maybe a forth
if you have build IC in your Country) Continue to upgrade and produce
more Divisions. It\'s also recommended if you have som land doctorine,
Infantry, Naval and Artillery researched. Now, Wait until the Finnish
Winter-war and choose Swedish intervention. Don\'t send all your troops
to Finland as the Soviet will kick your ass back to Sweden and if
you\'re unlucky: You will lose half of you army. Under this time, It\'s
recommended to have 2 fleets of 3 transports ship and a pool of at least
30 convoy ready to launch an assault on the Baltic stats. When the
Winter war is over, declare war on Estonia and Latvia. Ferry some troops
and take the weakest of Tallinn or Riga (every Baltic stat only got 1
province with victory points) first and Annex one of them first. Then
wait until the other capital is empty and then launch a Amphibious
assault and annex. When your done with Estonia and Latvia, Move your
troops to the border, Lithuania shall be very weakened do to the germen
attack on Poland. Declare war immediately and rush to the the capital
and Annex.

Now you shall be in the middle of 1940 and you may have around 55 IC
right now depends on If you have built IC or not. Upgrade your troops to
41 model Infantry and produce more armies to prepare an assault on
Ireland, Yes you can do that from Sweden because you controls the
northern part of the Atlantic. You shall be around 1942 when your troops
are ready and then ferry some men over to Ireland, Launch an Amphibious
assault and rush to the Capital and Annex. Now you got around 70 IC and
you\'re now a Swedish major power.

Either you can stop your conquest here OR choose from one of following:
Try to take parts of Northern Germany to Control the whole Eastern sea,
Do this when Soviet and The Allies are pushing the German back to
Germany, OR Produce some more troops and a better fleet to Occupy Spain.

When this is done and WWII is over. You can choose now to stay in
Neutrality or Join either the Allies or (If you\'re lucky enough)
Commintern. Depends on what strategy you\'re to play you shall choose
your side Carefully
