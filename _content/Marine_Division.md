## [ Notes ]{#Notes .mw-headline}

- Marine divisions are considered soft units.
- Marines have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard attack
  values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a normal
  infantry of the same year.
- Marines have less penalty performing [amphibious
  assaults](/wiki/Amphibious_assault "Amphibious assault") (the
  penalty is reduced even more the further along the tech tree you
  get) .
- Marines have less difficulties fighting in marshes and jungles.
