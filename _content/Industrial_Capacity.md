## [ Base IC ]{#Base_IC .mw-headline}

Base IC is based on the the number of factories you have in your
national provinces. If Albania, for example, has 4 factories in its
national provinces, then it will have a base IC of 4. One receives only
1 IC for every occupied province with any factories, so even if Beijing
has 5 factories, its owner Shanxi only receives 1 IC since Beijing is
not a national province of Shanxi.

On top of Base IC your actual IC is based on many different factors, for
example:

- [Minister Traits](/wiki/Minister_Traits "Minister Traits")
- [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"){.mw-redirect}
- [Dissent](/wiki/Dissent "Dissent")
- [Peacetime
  Modifier](/wiki/index.php?title=Peacetime_Modifier&action=edit&redlink=1 "Peacetime Modifier (page does not exist)"){.new}

## [ Minister Traits ]{#Minister_Traits .mw-headline}

For example, if a nation has a minister that gives an extra 5% of IC
(like Germany and Rudolf Hess), then the overall IC increases by 5% of
the Base IC. The same works for loss of IC.

## [ Technology ]{#Technology .mw-headline}

If a nation has technology giving them an extra percentage of IC, the
same process will occur as for Minister Traits.

## [ Dissent ]{#Dissent .mw-headline}

When a nation has a high percentage of dissent, the workers become more
reluctant to work and thus IC drops by a certain percentage. The only
way to remedy this is to raise Consumer Goods levels to curb dissent
before your IC drops below the amount of IC required for Consumer Goods.

## [ Peacetime Modifier ]{#Peacetime_Modifier .mw-headline}

If you control a large nation such as the United Kingdom, France or the
United States then you may have a peacetime modifier. This means that
your IC is quite far below the Base IC. This is because the nation is at
peace and not all the factories are required. Your Peacetime Modifier
will go once you go to war. A \'phoney war\' with a minor, faraway
nation like Paraguay is ideal to get around this problem.
