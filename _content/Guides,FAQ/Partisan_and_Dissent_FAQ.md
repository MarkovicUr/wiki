### [ ]{#Why_do_I_have_a_high_dissent_level?} [ Why do I have a high dissent level? ]{#Why_do_I_have_a_high_dissent_level.3F .mw-headline}

Some of the causes:

-   Not enough consumer goods allocated
-   Event effect
-   Change of minister
-   Not enough supply

### [ ]{#How_to_reduce_dissent?} [ How to reduce dissent? ]{#How_to_reduce_dissent.3F .mw-headline}

Dissent can be reduced by increasing the production of consumer goods.
Certain events also reduce dissent level.

Reduce any dissent and put garrisons with MP brigades in high partisan
activity provinces. Make sure to set the garrison\'s mission to
\'anti-partisan duty\'.

No.

No. In 1.3 base partisan levels do not decrease but instead will
slightly increase over time. You get the lowest base partisan level when
accepting events like Vichy (2%). Annexed territory has a much higher
base partisan level (25% for Germany) while occupied territory has the
highest base (33% for Germany).

Garrison divisions or garrison divisions with military police (MP)
brigades on antipartisan missions are the best way to reduce partisan
levels.

In previous versions of the game (1 thru 1.2), partisan levels in
annexed territory would gradually reduce to 2%.
