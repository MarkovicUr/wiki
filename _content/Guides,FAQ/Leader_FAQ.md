Before being promoted to the rank of Major General in September, 1939,
[Erwin Rommel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel){.external
.text rel="nofollow"} was first an instructor and then commander of the
War Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He is not in the game before 1939
because Major General is the lowest rank the game engine acknowledges.

A leader can be killed if he is involved in a battle and the current
year is his death year. A leader\'s death year is contained in the
leader files. There are a few tools in
[utilities](/wiki/Utilities "Utilities") section that can remove the
death date, but they will only affect future games, not any saved games
you may be playing.

Make sure you turn on auto-assign and wait for one day. If it does not
work, then one of these scenarios is true:

-   Your remaining leaders have higher leadership capacity than the
    number of divisions in the army. For example: if you have many
    generals and no mj. general left, your 1 division armies will not
    get an auto assigned leader.
-   Your remaining leaders have lower leadership capacity than the
    number of divisions in the army. For example: if you have many mj.
    generals but no general left, your 9 division armies will not get an
    auto assigned leader.

It is reset to 0 every time you promote the leader. Also note that the
leader\'s skill is reduced by one point as well with a promotion.

No, it only determines the starting rank of leaders when the scenario
starts.
