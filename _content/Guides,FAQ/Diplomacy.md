The **Diplomacy** screen is used to interact with other countries.
Everything from influencing countries to increase relations to joining
alliances and assuming military control of an ally is accessed via this
menu.

Some functions are locked based on sliders and economy. For instance,
you need certain amounts of money to **Join Alliance** - and if you\'re
democratic, or too isolationist, it will not allow you.
